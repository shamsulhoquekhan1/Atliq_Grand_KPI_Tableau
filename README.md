# Atliq_Grand_KPI_Tableau

A Tableau Analysis for the revenue management team from Atlip Grand Hotel in India. The project challenge was post on Codebasics website.

Context:

This is a project challenge that was published on: https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge. From the website (Challenge #1), the description of the challenge can be found and relevant dataset can be found. The challenge was expected to be done on PowerBI, but I have decided to do it using Tableau. 

Dataset:

Dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_aggregated_bookings, and fact_bookings are the data sets I used to build the dashboard. The metrics_list provides the list of metrics used by Hotel industry to track KPI. The data sets consist records of 3 months. It is important to know that Friday and Saturday are considered Weekend.
